The AbortController is a Web API that provides a way to abort or cancel asynchronous 
operations in JavaScript, including those in Node.js. It allows you to signal that 
an operation should be canceled, which can be particularly useful for tasks like HTTP requests, 
timers, or any asynchronous operation that you want to terminate prematurely.
