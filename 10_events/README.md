### Events

The events module is a built-in module that provides an event-driven programming interface for creating and handling 
custom events. It is the foundation of many other modules and libraries in Node.js, including the EventEmitter class, 
which is the core of the events module. This module allows you to define, emit, and listen for custom events 
within your applications.
