### Timers

In Node.js, you can work with timers to schedule the execution of code at specified intervals or after a certain delay. 
Timers are a crucial part of asynchronous programming in Node.js, and they are managed through the setTimeout, setInterval, 
and clearTimeout/clearInterval functions. These timers allow you to execute code asynchronously without blocking the main event loop.

Here's an overview of how to use timers in Node.js:

`setTimeout(callback, delay[, ...args])`: This function schedules a callback function to be executed once 
after a specified delay (in milliseconds). You can also pass additional arguments to the callback function.

`setInterval(callback, delay[, ...args])`: This function schedules a callback function to be executed repeatedly 
at a specified interval (in milliseconds). It continues until you explicitly stop it using clearInterval.

`clearTimeout(timeoutId)`: This function cancels a previously scheduled setTimeout operation before it can execute.

`clearInterval(intervalId)`: This function stops a previously created interval timer.

Timers are commonly used in Node.js for various purposes, including:

Scheduling periodic tasks, such as checking for updates.
Implementing timeouts for network requests or other asynchronous operations.
Controlling animations or updates in web applications.
It's important to note that Node.js is a single-threaded environment, so timers are particularly useful 
for executing non-blocking code, allowing your application to remain responsive while performing asynchronous tasks. 
However, you should be mindful of callback execution times to avoid blocking the event loop.
